There's a few non-MLM, ethically and moral ways to optimize your finances. A few things I'm cosidering is:
1. Learn to save and reduce your expenses
  - eat in, cook at home, save lunch for work
  - reduce dinners out to at most 1-2 times a week
2. Limit your lesiurely/hobby expenses to a capped amount per month
3. Invest! Put your savings into TFSA and lastly RRSP if need be
  - TFSA is after-tax cash into that account, but learn to invest defensively/smartly to earn tax free gains (currently using Questrade)
  - RRSP is pre-tax (you get the taxed amount back in non-RRSP cash), and saves for long-term so invest aggressively in index funds (currently I'm using TD e-series)
4. Credit card churning
5. Do side gigs and utilize your freelancing skills
6. Start a business
