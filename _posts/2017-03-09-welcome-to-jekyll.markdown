This post will be my first post using jekyll to build. This entire static website is generated by jekyll which is fortunately supported on github. You'll find this post in `_posts` directory.

So today I'm writing all of this while at work with extra time left to kill. I simply call `jekyll serve` and that'll generate the which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated in the `_site` folder.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
