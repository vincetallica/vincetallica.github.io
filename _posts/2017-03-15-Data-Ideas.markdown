What are some software application startup ideas? I've been thinking of a few, and the top filtered ones are:

1. A 'blind-dating' app idea based on the idea that only friends can match you with another friend's set of friends (at least 2 degree of connections, at most 4 degrees of connections). These are the key features that I will implement:

2. A real-estate 1% commission buy/sell automated platform for buyers and sellers of residential and businesses.
  - issue: hard to get real-time market values on real-estate in Vancouver BC without license (even with license hard to get the information, albeit people have stated it's not as 'hard' as it seems)
