What are some software application startup ideas? I've been thinking of a few, and the top filtered ones are:

1. A 'blind-dating' app idea based on the idea that only friends can match you with another friend's set of friends (at least 2 degree of connections, at most 4 degrees of connections). These are the key features that I will implement:
  - on signup, user login by facebook (there can be fake fb accounts, ignore corner case for now)
  - user chooses whether they will be matchee(to be matched), or matcher (to match friends)
          - AND cases are worth considering (matchee != matcher)
  - as a matcher:
      - scan through list of friends that signed up to be matched
      - based on list of friends (AI algorithm to suggest matchees based on personalities from smart analysis of FB personalities (via photos, birthdate, or guess of personalities))
      - user chooses matchees, and send a standardized text to set them up on a date
          - auto book restaurants/locations, sends email/text, and auto schedules them (this might be bit hard, need access to their google calendars)
      - matchers can be rated
  - as a matchee:
      - just describe yourself a bit (no pics needed), idea is look doesn't matter
      - wait to be matched (receive notification via email/text)
  - capped at 2 matches per matcher (max, so people don't get spammed)

2. A real-estate 1% commission buy/sell automated platform for buyers and sellers of residential and businesses.
  - issue: hard to get real-time market values on real-estate in Vancouver BC without license (even with license hard to get the information, albeit people have stated it's not as 'hard' as it seems)
