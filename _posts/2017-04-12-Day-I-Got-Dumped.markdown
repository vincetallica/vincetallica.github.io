So cross the bigtuna.io company out, I'm no longer vested in it. I just got dumped.
I think it felt like good hard blow to my heart. I guess this is the small taste of being dumped.

I get it. I didn't help out on the mass soldering as much as I should have or said I would (promised? to). I got off on a wrong footing when I posted members name on the company site.  The guy who made the PCB took my access away.  From there, I really didn't want to initiate or help out.

I think it's for the best, the technology was nothing new, nothing breathtaking. But it was still a product, that I was hoping I can help build up. At long last, that is not the case.

I'm still kind of licking my wounds, but I think in the end I think it's for the best, because the founder has lost confidence in my ability to contribute, and to help out.

Goodbye bigtunaio.
