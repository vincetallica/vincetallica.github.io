I have been thinking recently about what's a perfect day for me. Here's what I got:

{% highlight ruby %}
6:30AM - 8AM, wakeup, cleanup, workout in the morning
8AM - 12PM - start working on work
12PM - 2PM - lunch and talk with friends/business partners
2PM - 5:30pm - more work ideally with people (social)
5:30 PM-10PM home for dinner with family and wife, do work around house
{% endhighlight %}

How can I achieve this?  Apparently learning to make online income is a good way.
