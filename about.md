My name is Vincent. A few words to describe me: prudent, analytical and grit.

I am fascinated by creative solutions, algorithms and data structures, and the frontier of technology. I want to use this website to showcase my life and creativity.

I currently build websites, and is trying to develop and improve software solutions to problems.

Since 2017, I am currently a Senior ASIC Design & Verification Engineer at Icron Technologies (part of [Maxim Integrated](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en.html)) leading verification architecture and development for IPs, PHYs and systemlevel.
From 2016-2017 -> design verification engineer at a startup called NETINT (Istuary) and learnt a great deal.
From 2013-2016 -> Embedded Systems Engineer, then a Component Design Engineer at [Intel](http://intel.com) working on their Optane technology ASIC (the new type of SSD) verifying subblocks and cluster-level in UVM/SV and OOP design verification.
From 2008-2013 -> a First Class Honours Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering from [Simon Fraser University](http://sfu.ca). My undergraduate thesis was on CUDA acceleration of retinal layer segmentation from [OCT data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography).  I have
written about my undergraduate research experience here, and software I helped
develop during my UG here.
