![My name is Vincent.](/assets/blueman.jpg)

I am a ASIC Design & Verification Engineer who currently work at Istuary Innovation Labs on a Network ASIC edge solution.
I am fascinated by creative solutions (not necessarily technology) to solve a prevailing problem.
I want to use this website to showcase my life and creativity.

Before working at Istuary, I was an Component Design Engineer at [Intel](http://intel.com) working on their Optane technology ASIC.
Before that, I got a First Class Honours - Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering from [Simon Fraser University](http://sfu.ca). My undergrad thesis was on CUDA acceleration of retinal layer segmentation from [OCT data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography).  I have
written about my UG research experience here, and software I helped
develop during my UG here.
