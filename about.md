I am a ASIC engineer who currently work at Istuary(http://twitter.com).
I have always been fascinated by technology as a creative solution to a prevailing problem.
I want to use this website to help teach people new skills.

Before working at Istuary, I was an ASIC engineer at [Intel](http://intel.com) working on their Optane technology ASIC.
Before that, I got a First Class Honours - Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering from [Simon Fraser University](http://sfu.ca). My undergrad thesis was on CUDA acceleration of retinal layer segmentation from [OCT data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coherence_tomography).  I have
written about my UG research experience here, and software I helped
develop during my UG here.
